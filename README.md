Number Guessing Game (Python)

Description:
A simple console-based Python program where the user tries to guess a randomly generated number.
The program provides feedback after each guess: too high, too low, or correct.
This demonstrates basic Python concepts such as classes, random numbers, and console input/output.

SDLC Summary:

Requirement Analysis:
The project requirement was to build a program allowing a user to guess a number generated by the computer.
The system should provide clear instructions, accept numeric input, and respond with meaningful feedback.
It should handle valid input gracefully and provide an interactive experience.

Design:
The program was designed around a single class called GuessGame.
This class handles random number generation and evaluates the user's guesses.
A class-based design ensures modularity, easier maintenance, and future extendibility.
The console interface was designed to be simple and intuitive for the user.

Implementation:
Implemented entirely in Python as a console application.
The class GuessGame is initialized with a random number between 1 and 10.
The start() method manages input and feedback.
All logic is contained in one file for simplicity and ease of deployment.

Testing:
Manual testing was performed by running the program multiple times and entering different guesses.
Tested scenarios include correct guesses, guesses too high, guesses too low, and program stability.
Manual testing ensures reliability and correctness of the game.

Deployment:
The program can be deployed by sharing the Python file or uploading it to GitHub.
No external dependencies are required, so it runs on any system with Python installed.
Users can easily run it in a console or terminal with a single command.

Maintenance:
Future improvements could include replay functionality, adjustable difficulty, and enhanced input validation.
Maintenance ensures the program remains functional, user-friendly, and adaptable for learning purposes.
Even small projects benefit from proper maintenance and documentation.

How to Run:
Open terminal or console.
