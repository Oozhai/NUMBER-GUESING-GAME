# SDLC Summary

## Requirement Analysis:
The first step in the software development process is to identify and define the requirements of the system. For this project, the main requirement was to allow a user to guess a number generated by the computer. The program should provide meaningful feedback for each guess, clearly informing the user whether their guess is correct, too high, or too low.

Additional requirements include ensuring that the program can handle valid numeric input without errors and runs smoothly in a console environment. Optional enhancements, such as replaying the game or increasing the difficulty range, were considered but kept simple for the initial version. This step ensures that the project scope is clear and achievable for a beginner-level Python program.

### Design:
The design of the program focuses on simplicity and modularity. A single class, GuessGame, was created to handle all game logic. This class generates a random number between 1 and 10 when initialized and provides a start() method that manages user input and game feedback.

The design separates the game logic from program execution, making it easier to maintain or extend the program in the future. This approach demonstrates how object-oriented principles can be applied even in small projects. Additionally, the console interface was designed to be intuitive, guiding the user through each step of the game. Clear instructions and prompts are part of the design to improve the user experience.

### Implementation:
The program was implemented using Python 3, which allows for rapid development and easy testing. The class GuessGame is responsible for generating the secret number using Python’s random module and for evaluating the user’s guesses using conditional statements.

The start() method prompts the user for input, checks the guess, and prints feedback. If the guess is correct, the user receives a congratulatory message; if the guess is too high or too low, the user is informed and encouraged to try again in a future run.

The code is structured in a single file, game.py, making it easy to share and deploy. The implementation is lightweight, with no external dependencies, which ensures that the program can run on any system with Python installed.

### Testing:
Testing was performed manually to ensure that all program features work as intended. Multiple test cases were executed, including guesses that are correct, too high, and too low.

The random number generation was tested by running the program several times to confirm variability. Input handling was tested with valid numeric input to ensure the program does not crash. Through these tests, the reliability and correctness of the program were verified. The manual testing approach also helped identify minor improvements, such as enhancing user prompts for clarity.

### Deployment:
The deployment process involves uploading the Python file to a GitHub repository. Since the program is self-contained and has no external dependencies, deployment is straightforward. Users can download the file and run it in their console using a simple Python command.

The deployment strategy focuses on accessibility and ease of use, allowing beginners or other students to experiment with the code without needing additional setup or installations. Sharing the program on GitHub also demonstrates the ability to document and distribute software effectively.

### Maintenance:
Future maintenance may include bug fixes, improving input validation, and adding optional features like replaying the game without restarting or adjusting the difficulty level. Maintenance ensures that the program remains functional, user-friendly, and adaptable for further learning purposes.
